## Game Material

- 1 Super Card  
- 1 rule booklet

## Aim of the Game
Bandido is trying to escape **AGAIN**.  

**Team up to stop him!**

This is a **cooperative game**, which means that all players play together. Place your cards so that all tunnels are blocked and Bandido cannot break out of jail.

---

## Setting Up the Game
1. Find the Super Card and place it in the middle of a large table. Use either the easy or the normal side of the Super Card, depending on the level of difficulty you desire (5 or 6 exits).
2. Shuffle the cards and place them face down in a draw pile.
3. Each player takes three cards.

## How to Play
- The youngest player starts.
- On your turn, place one of your cards to connect it to one or more cards already on the table.
- Since Bandido is a cooperative game, players should discuss the best way to proceed,  
  but **you’re not allowed to show your cards** to the other players.
- The card you play **must fit perfectly**.
- After placing your card, draw a new one from the pile.
- If you can’t play, you may place your cards under the draw pile and take three new ones.
- Take care not to place a card that makes it impossible to block off a tunnel.
- Keep playing until you have blocked all the tunnels or the draw pile is empty.

## End of the Game
- If you manage to block off **all tunnels**, you **win**.
- Otherwise, **Bandido escapes** and you **all lose**.
